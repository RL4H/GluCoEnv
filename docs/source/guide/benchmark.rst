Benchmark
============

In order to benchmark glucose control algorithms we define simulation protocols and provide a benchmark controller called :guilabel:`SBB`, which replicated the standard clinical treatment. We additionally provide capability to replicate different forms of :guilabel:`SBB` control.

Todo: Add explainer on standard basal bolus, equation etc.
