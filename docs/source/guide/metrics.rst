Clinical Metrics
============

The performance of glucose control algorithms can be evaluated in terms of the reward. However, it is important to evaluate in terms of Clinical Metrics to better reflect the real-world problem. Here we summarise these clinical metrics, which are also implemented and can be directly used to evaluate the developed RL algorithms.
